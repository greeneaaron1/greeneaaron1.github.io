I am a curious builder who likes to mix long-form thinking with hands-on making. This space is where I keep notes, share ideas that are still in progress, and document the small details that tend to get lost. Over time it has become a home for experiments, reflections, and the occasional deep dive.

My work blends a few different interests, so you will see a mix of writing, projects, and the tools I use to keep everything moving. Some posts are polished, some are sketches, and many are simply a way to think out loud. If something here sparks a question or a connection, that is a good day.

Outside of the screen, I try to stay curious and grounded. I spend time learning, listening, and making space for the people and places that matter. This page will evolve, but the goal stays the same: keep things honest, useful, and human.
